# Unsafe SQL Bulder

This is a small personal project dedicated to creating a simple SQL builder for Python. The primary use case for this tool is to programmatically assemble complex queries for the purposes of data analysis.

This tool is specifically labelled as "Unsafe" because any SQL-query-string-bulding-related safety concerns, e.g. input parameter sanitization to prevent SQL injections, fall outside the scope of this project and will not be considered.
